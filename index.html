      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a third year transfer student at UCLA. I am a Communication Studies major with a computing specialization. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Santa Clarita, California. It is the city that has Magic Mountain.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am into fountain pens. So far I have about 5 of them and a variety of papers to write on. I also like to play video games and anything tech related.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is one that allows me to be creative and explore different ways on how to do things while still being technical. I enjoy very harmonious work enviroments and dislike drama so anywhere that has a neutral to positive work enviroment would be ideal. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I used to live in in the UCLA dorms but ever since the COVID-19 outbreak I have decided to move back home to Santa Clarita.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>It is a great thing to have on your resume but it also melds my creative side and technical side into one job.</p>
